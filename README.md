# openwhisk-go

This repository holds and implementation of an OpenWhisk Go client, as well as examples for how to build arbitrary actions using Go.

## client

Implementation of an OpenWhisk client that allows for function invocation.

## docker

Docker files for particular Go environments on top of OpenWhisk base images.

## models

Implementation of object models for `client`.

## examples

Multiple examples for how to use two two client APIs, as well as how to write Docker containers that OpenWhisk can interact with.

## swagger_client / swagger_models

OpenWhisk API client and models generated by swagger-go. Action invocation seems broken, so we rely on `client`/`model` for that functionality.

## Updating the Swagger-generated client

Run `./update.sh`
