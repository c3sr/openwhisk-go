# openwhisk-go

This repository holds and implementation of an OpenWhisk Go client, as well as examples for how to build arbitrary actions using Go.

## client

Implementation of an OpenWhisk client that allows for function invocation.

## docker

Docker files for particular Go environments on top of OpenWhisk base images.

## models

Implementation of object models for `client`.

## examples

Multiple examples for how to use two two client APIs, as well as how to write Docker containers that OpenWhisk can interact with.

## jsoncall

Library that allows arbitrary Go functions to be called with JSON-formatted arguments and return values. For example:

let `args` be `{"0": 6, "1": 3}`

```
func div(x,y int) int {
    return x / y
}

results := CallWithJSON(div, args)
```

results is then `{"0": 2}`

The JSON is indexed by the number of the argument and result.


## swagger_client / swagger_models

OpenWhisk API client and models generated by swagger-go. Action invocation seems broken, so we rely on `client`/`model` for that functionality.

## Updating the Swagger-generated client

Run `./update.sh`
